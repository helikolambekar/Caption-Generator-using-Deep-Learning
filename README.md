# Caption-Generator-using-Deep-Learning
generate accurate captions for the images in the Microsoft COCO dataset. The project uses InceptionV3 to detect objects in the images. The deep learning model uses an encoder and a decoder with GRU and dense layers tuned with an attention module to generate captions.
